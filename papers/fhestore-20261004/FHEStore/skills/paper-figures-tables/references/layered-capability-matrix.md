# Layered Capability Matrix

Use this design guide for a load-bearing Related Work table whose capability
dimensions follow the paper's own conceptual layers. It is not the default for
ordinary comparison tables.

## When Grouping Helps

Use semantic column groups when they clarify the comparison:

- the table carries a central positioning argument rather than a literature inventory;
- the retained dimensions are defensible and relevant;
- the groups represent relationships among those dimensions;
- the grouping mirrors a model, lifecycle, architecture, or analytical split already explained in the manuscript;
- the selected layout remains readable at final width.

Use the compact pattern in `tables.md` for a compact set of flat dimensions. Use
`dense-empirical-tables.md` for dense result or evidence tables that do not make
uniqueness claims about a literature corpus.

## Evidence Contract

- Define the comparison corpus and its exclusions in prose, the caption, or a table note.
- Assign each marker from source-backed row evidence. Do not infer coverage from a title, abstract keyword, or citation proximity alone.
- A named family row receives `\cmark` only when every included member supports the displayed capability. Use `\pmark` for mixed, incomplete, or qualified support.
- A proposed or this-work row must name a manuscript artifact and support every marker from that artifact.
- Shade or label a cell as a coverage delta only when the distinction is supported against every compared row.
- Unless the comparison corpus is exhaustive, say "absent from the compared rows" rather than universally "unique to this work."

Marker meaning must be supported by row evidence. The example glyphs and row or
cell highlighting are adaptable presentation choices; alternative clear symbols
are valid when their meaning is defined.

## Layout Contract

- Start with `table*` at the top of a page and verify the venue's float rules.
- Use `\multicolumn` and `\cmidrule` for semantic column layers.
- Keep a `Type` column when it prevents unlike studies, tools, standards, or datasets from being read as interchangeable.
- Use a fixed-width, ragged-right first column and remove unused outer padding with `@{}`.
- Start at `\footnotesize`; use `\scriptsize` only after final-width QA shows that it remains comfortably readable.
- Adjust cell spacing and row height for the actual content; the skeleton below is an example.
- Prefer whitespace and `\cmidrule` to vertical rules. Use sparse separators only when they clarify necessary semantic boundaries.
- Use `threeparttable` only when actual `tablenotes` are present.
- Keep the caption focused on the table's claim and scope. Put secondary abbreviations, corpus boundaries, and caveats in notes.
- Pair a meaning-bearing cell tint with a non-color cue such as `\dagger`.

## Generic LaTeX Skeleton

Adapt the group names, row labels, and markers only from manuscript evidence.
Do not copy paper-specific citations or capability assignments from a reference
table.

## Final QA

Render at the actual `\textwidth` and confirm:

- group labels align with the correct column ranges;
- abbreviations are locally defined and do not force avoidable line breaks;
- every marker and delta cue has a source-evidence entry;
- the table remains intelligible in grayscale and without relying on tint;
- the caption, notes, and Related Work prose state the same comparison boundary;
- no claim expands from the compared corpus to all prior work.
