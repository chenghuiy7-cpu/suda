# Artifact Policy Integration

Apply relevant sibling `paper-policy` rules to artifact work. Use the structured
context, evidence inventory and CLI below when formal artifact compliance or
submission readiness is requested. An ordinary plot or caption task does not
require a context file, evidence ledger or human sign-off before delivery.
Keep creation in this skill and formal aggregation in `paper-policy`/`paper-review`.

## Resolve Context

Declare `figure` or `table` in `artifacts`, then declare semantic types in
`features`:

- figures: `paper_figure`, plus `data_figure` or `conceptual_figure`; add
  `generated_conceptual_figure` whenever an image model produces the final
  conceptual artifact;
- tables: `related_work_table`, `data_table`, or
  `result_table`;
- use `artifact_mode: final_figure` or `final_table` for a single final QA
  profile; use `[final_figure, final_table]` when a full-paper run must compose
  both profiles.

Run:

```bash
python3 ../paper-policy/scripts/resolve_policy.py paper_context.yaml
```

Choose renderer, font and marker style for accuracy, readability and explicit
venue requirements. Apply the requirements selected for the actual artifact.

## Record Artifact Evidence

Add each artifact to the shared `compliance-evidence.yaml` under `artifacts`.
Record a stable ID, kind, types, supported claim, outputs, scripts, source data,
previews, and table sources. For every table, also record the exact
`latex_label`; the checker resolves that label to one `table` or `table*`
environment as a deterministic source check. Final-render readability, units,
and marker meaning require separate evidence under `TABLE.FINAL_READABLE`;
booktabs and particular marker glyphs are not mandatory checks. Paths may be
absolute or relative to the selected
`--artifact-root`; they may point to a separate replication bundle rather than
requiring the data and scripts to live inside the LaTeX project. Read
`../../paper-policy/references/compliance-schema.md` for the schema.

For an existing LaTeX manuscript, the policy runner can seed this inventory:

```bash
python3 ../paper-policy/scripts/discover_artifacts.py /path/to/paper \
  --primary-tex paper.tex \
  --output artifact-manifest-skeleton.yaml
```

The skeleton is deliberately guarded with
`discovery_status: needs_confirmation`. It cannot be used as evidence until a
reviewer checks each artifact's type, claim, label, paths, source data, and
scripts and changes the status to `confirmed`.

Run reliable source checks:

```bash
python3 ../paper-policy/scripts/check_artifacts.py \
  compliance-evidence.yaml --root /path/to/paper
```

Then aggregate with manuscript compliance:

```bash
python3 ../paper-policy/scripts/assess_compliance.py \
  paper_context.yaml --project /path/to/paper \
  --evidence compliance-evidence.yaml
```

The `files.scripts` list can contain notebooks or shared pipeline files; locate
the figure-specific function/cell/command in the associated evidence. The format
checker establishes file presence and recognizes common formats; suitability,
resolution and venue acceptance require inspection. An unfamiliar extension is
a `review_hint`, not a definite violation or an automatic PASS.

## Final-Width Readability

Choose source dimensions and text sizes from the actual placement width. If the
source canvas is enlarged, scale line widths, markers and offsets consistently.
Export a suitable format, place it at the target width, and inspect clipping,
density, label readability, grayscale distinctions and alignment.

Agent inspection supports editing and delivery. For a formal assessment,
`FIG.FINAL_WIDTH_READABLE` retains its manual evidence requirement and all governed
`artifact_refs`; leave it `UNVERIFIED` without admissible human/user/venue evidence.
Source points alone never establish readability and require no adaptation record.

## Evidence Boundary

- File existence does not prove that values, rows, components, or arrows are
  correct.
- Marker tokens do not prove that related-work rows are defensible.
- A cell tint or dagger does not prove that a capability is absent from the
  comparison corpus; record the corpus boundary and row-wise evidence.
- A font name or formula in a prompt does not prove accurate or readable
  rendering; inspect the actual artifact.
- Preserve source artifacts and transformation records. Judge the final
  content against the manuscript and follow the selected tools' constraints.
- Vector export does not prove color accessibility.
- A declared script does not prove that it produced the inspected output.

Use semantic/manual evidence records for those judgments. Never edit result
status directly to bypass a failing source check.
