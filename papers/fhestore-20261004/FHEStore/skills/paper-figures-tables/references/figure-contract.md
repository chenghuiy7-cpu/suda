# Figure Contract

For a complex figure, capture the scientific purpose, sources, encodings and target placement in existing notes or a short spec. `figure_spec.yaml` below is optional; a simple supplied plot need not create an extra workflow file.

```yaml
figure:
  slug: semantic-utility-main
  manuscript_target: paper/sections/05_experiments.tex
  placement: main-text
  target_width: double-column
  claim: MethodA preserves more allowed task flow than cost-only cover at matched full privacy cover.
  reader_takeaway: Privacy coverage is matched; the difference is semantic utility preservation.
  structural_reference: figures/semantic-utility-main/structure.svg
  background: pure white

source_data:
  - path: runs/example/test_metrics.json
    role: primary metrics
  - path: runs/example/bootstrap.csv
    role: uncertainty intervals

panels:
  - id: A
    plot_type: grouped_bar
    metrics: [pure_utility_loss, task_flow_preservation, overall_flow_preservation]
    methods: [MethodA, BaselineA, BaselineB]
    message: MethodA has lower loss and higher allowed-flow preservation.
  - id: B
    plot_type: interval_bar
    metrics: [baseline_minus_method_loss_margin]
    message: The paired margin is positive with a non-overlapping CI.

encoding:
  proposed: MethodA
  baselines: [BaselineA, BaselineB]
  color_roles: [method, baseline, neutral]
  uncertainty: paired bootstrap 95% CI

caption:
  draft: >
    Matched full-cover utility comparison. All cover methods satisfy the same privacy-cover constraint;
    MethodA preserves more task-required and overall allowed flow than cost-only cover.

validation:
  - Values match source files.
  - Labels are readable at target width.
  - Caption does not claim deployable online protection unless the data supports it.
```

## Decisions When a Spec Helps

- **Purpose:** the comparison, definition, evidence pattern or mechanism the figure lets the reader inspect.
- **Source data:** exact local paths or generated `source_data.csv`.
- **Panel map:** panel IDs, plot type, metric, method/condition order, and message.
- **Structural reference:** include a wireframe when it helps preserve topology; reuse an existing editable diagram source when sufficient.
- **Typography:** identify text and mathematical roles; verify readable, accurate, manuscript-compatible rendering.
- **Production record:** preserve source files and record transformations; follow the selected tools' constraints.
- **Conditions:** assumptions or settings needed to interpret the figure; do not manufacture a list of unclaimed capabilities.
- **Caption boundary:** what belongs in the paper caption versus artifact audit notes.
- **Placement:** identify final dimensions and any source-to-placement scaling needed to reproduce the figure.
- **Final-width evidence:** record the preview and actual evaluator; agent inspection must not be labeled human evidence. Formal manual checks remain governed by the compliance schema.

## Conceptual Figure Structure Policy

Before visual design, record manuscript-supported components, directed/typed
connections, boundaries, exact labels and the reader takeaway. Classify figure
type separately from column span; include actual target width, height budget,
layout choice and how supported information justifies the occupied area.
An optional `structure.svg` can constrain complex topology.

For new conceptual figures, follow `conceptual-figures.md`: ImageGen visual design
followed by editable SVG reconstruction. Keep the selected design/prompt and
content brief as distinct references; content controls semantics, the design
controls visual fidelity. Check both independently using
`conceptual-vector-rebuild.md`, then inspect the final placement. Record material
deviations and residual raster content. Existing small editable-source changes
and explicit user/venue requirements follow the workflow's scoped exceptions.

## Source Data Policy

- Prefer copying a small plot-ready table to `source_data.csv` when the raw artifact is large or nested.
- Preserve the raw artifact path in `figure_spec.yaml`.
- Put transformations in the plotting script, not in undocumented manual edits.
- Use stable method labels that match the paper text.

## Caption Policy

Use `captions.md` for the artifact type. Explain the setup, encodings and conditions needed to read the figure. Include a result or interpretation when helpful; do not require a takeaway or anticipatory disclaimer in every caption.
